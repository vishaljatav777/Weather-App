# Weather-App

This Weather App allows you to find the current temperature of any city.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**  
If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.  
This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them.  
All commands except `eject` will still work but will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them.  
At this point, you are on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The default setup is suitable for most small and medium deployments, but the option is available if you need more customization.

## About
